Custom Flightgear Layout for Monect:

This custom layout can be imported into Monect (Mobile PC remote app) and used to control and fly aircraft in FlightGear. This is possibly the best solution to those wanting to fly difficult aircraft such as helicopters without any joystick or flightsim setups or equipment.

Installation:

Installing the layout is pretty easy, simply download the layout and the app if you haven't already. Next, head to 'Layouts', click the '+' button & click the 'Install Layout' button. This should bring you to files, there search for the 'mlo' file and the layout should be installed. Note: The app may need to be refreshed.

TODO:
1. Make it neat
2. Add more buttons

Still a W.I.P, feel free to edit it yourself!
